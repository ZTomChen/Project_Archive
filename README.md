## 2nd year system engineering
This project aims to design and develop a vending machine prototype. Components such as processing unit, pneumatic actuator and aluminium T-slot profiles were provided. We were tasked to design a suitable 3D printed delivering mechanism, and implemented high level control logic and user interface in PLC. 

## 3rd year design unit
This project aims to build a robot rover which retrieves objects in sequence autonomously. All components except some basic electronic components were sourced by ourselves. It is a complex project requiring both hardware and software designs. I took the lead in the mechanical design and navigation. 

## Final year project
My final year project focuses on a novel camera, event camera. It senses only the change in light intensity which is the dynamic component of a scene. The information is then sent to the processor asynchronously via ROS packages. The project aim is to analyse the received data and fit the best motion model.
